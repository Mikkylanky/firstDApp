# Ethereum dApp Starter
* This is a simple Ethereum dApp starter from [LearnWeb3 Ethereum Developer Degree](https://learnweb3.io/degrees/ethereum-developer-degree/freshman/build-your-first-d-app-on-ethereum/)
* The goal is to create a basic Solidity smart contract and a simple frontend with two buttons that can interact with the smart contract functions.
* MetaMask was used for wallet management, Remix IDE for Solidity smart contract, and Ethers.js for contract interaction.
